# Steam Game Recommendations using SQL Server

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyze and recommend Steam games using SQL Server as the primary database management system. By leveraging structured query language (SQL), I process and explore large datasets to uncover gaming trends, evaluate user preferences, and generate data-driven recommendations.

My approach includes:

+ Data Exploration: Examining key attributes such as game genres, release dates, player reviews, and pricing trends to gain insights into the gaming landscape.

+ User Behavior Analysis: Identifying patterns in player preferences, playtime, and review sentiments to better understand what makes a game popular.

+ Game Recommendations: Using SQL queries and ranking techniques to suggest games based on various factors such as genre similarity, popularity, and user interest.

Through this project, I demonstrate how SQL can be effectively utilized for data-driven decision-making in the gaming industry, providing valuable insights for both players and developers.
